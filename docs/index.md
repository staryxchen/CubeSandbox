features:
  - title: "⚡ Ultra-fast Startup"
    details: Resource pooling and snapshot cloning skip all cold-start overhead. Sandbox creation faster than a blink.
  - title: "🔒 Hardware Isolation"
    details: Every sandbox runs a dedicated OS kernel in its own MicroVM.
  - title: "🔌 E2B SDK Compatible"
    details: Drop-in replacement for E2B Cloud. Switch by changing one environment variable — zero client code changes.
  - title: "📦 High-density Deployment"
    details: MB-level per-sandbox overhead enables thousands of instances per server via kernel sharing and Copy-on-Write.
  - title: "🛡️ Network Security"
    details: eBPF-based CubeVS enforces strict inter-sandbox isolation and fine-grained egress filtering at the kernel level.
  - title: "📸 State Management"
    details: "Checkpoint, restore, and fork sandbox states for parallel development and multi-version testing. (Coming soon)"
