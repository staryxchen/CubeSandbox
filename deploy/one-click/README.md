# Cube Sandbox One-Click

This directory is used to build and deliver the single-machine one-click release package for `cube-sandbox`.

## Directory Overview

- `build-release-bundle-builder.sh`: Recommended entry point. Compiles the components needed by one-click inside a builder image, then continues the release package assembly on the host machine.
- `build-vm-assets.sh`: Builds `containerd-shim-cube-rs`, `cube-runtime`, and `cube-agent`; injects `cube-agent` into the guest image as `/sbin/init`; and collects the guest kernel.
- `build-release-bundle.sh`: Low-level packaging entry point. Consumes either the source tree or `ONE_CLICK_*_BIN` pre-built artifacts, assembles `sandbox-package`, and produces the final release package.
- `config-cube.toml`: Default one-click runtime configuration template.
- `support/`: `docker compose` templates for MySQL/Redis, installed to `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/support/` on the target machine; `support/bin/mkcert` is the bundled mkcert binary.
- `cubeproxy/`: Compose template, `global.conf` template, CoreDNS template, and wrapper Dockerfile for `cube proxy`.
- `install.sh`: Entry point for installing and starting the control node on the target machine (defaults to all-in-one mode).
- `install-compute.sh`: Entry point for installing a compute node on the target machine.
- `down.sh`: Stops the services and dependencies installed by one-click.
- `smoke.sh`: Runs basic health checks.
- `env.example`: Shared environment variable template for both the build machine and the target machine.
- `lib/common.sh`: Common shell utility functions.
- `scripts/one-click/`: Start/stop and validation scripts executed after installation.
- `sql/`: MySQL initialization schema and seed data.

## Build Inputs

The only fixed file that needs to be prepared is the guest kernel `vmlinux`:

- `vmlinux`

By default it is placed under `assets/kernel-artifacts/`, but can be overridden via an environment variable:

```bash
export ONE_CLICK_CUBE_KERNEL_VMLINUX=/abs/path/to/vmlinux
```

The guest image no longer depends on a local zip file. Instead, it is generated locally from `deploy/guest-image/Dockerfile` during the one-click release package build. Common override parameters:

```bash
export ONE_CLICK_GUEST_IMAGE_DOCKERFILE=/abs/path/to/cube-sandbox/deploy/guest-image/Dockerfile
# Optional; defaults to the directory containing the Dockerfile
export ONE_CLICK_GUEST_IMAGE_CONTEXT_DIR=/abs/path/to/cube-sandbox/deploy/guest-image
# Optional; defaults to cube-sandbox-guest-image:one-click
export ONE_CLICK_GUEST_IMAGE_REF=cube-sandbox-guest-image:one-click
# Optional; defaults to the current repository revision
export ONE_CLICK_GUEST_IMAGE_VERSION=custom-guest-image-version
```

## Building the Release Package

It is recommended to copy the environment template first:

```bash
cd deploy/one-click
cp env.example .env
```

Run the following from the repository root on the host machine (recommended):

```bash
./deploy/one-click/build-release-bundle-builder.sh
```

This entry point will:

- Compile `cubemaster`, `cubemastercli`, `cubelet`, `cubecli`, `cube-api`, `network-agent`, `cube-agent`, `containerd-shim-cube-rs`, and `cube-runtime` inside a container using the root-level builder image.
- Run `go mod download` for `CubeMaster` and `Cubelet` inside the builder. The first build will fetch Go modules online; subsequent builds reuse the module cache under the builder's HOME directory.
- Place the pre-built artifacts in `deploy/one-click/.work/prebuilt/`.
- Return to the host machine and call `build-release-bundle.sh` to continue with guest image generation and final packaging.

If the build machine already has a complete toolchain, or you want to specify `ONE_CLICK_*_BIN` manually, you can invoke the low-level entry point directly:

```bash
./deploy/one-click/build-release-bundle.sh
```

Regardless of which entry point is used, `CubeMaster` / `Cubelet` no longer depend on the `vendor/` directory in the repository; dependencies are resolved at build time via Go modules.

### Go Modules Dependency Download

- `go mod download` is executed the first time `CubeMaster` and `Cubelet` are built.
- The build machine must be able to reach the relevant module sources. If you are behind a private network, configure `GOPROXY`, `GOPRIVATE`, and private repository credentials in advance.
- The recommended entry point persists the builder HOME to a host-side cache directory, so subsequent builds on the same machine typically do not require a full re-download.
- `cubelog` is still referenced as a local module via `../cubelog` and is not downloaded from a remote source.

On success, the following file will be generated:

```bash
deploy/one-click/dist/cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>.tar.gz
```

The release package contains:

- `sandbox-package.tar.gz`
- `CubeAPI/bin/cube-api`
- `containerd-shim-cube-rs`, `cube-runtime`
- Locally built `cube-image/cube-guest-image-cpu.img`
- `cubeproxy/` directory and its build context
- `support/` directory and its compose templates
- `cube-kernel-scf.zip` packaged on the fly from `vmlinux`
- `install.sh` / `install-compute.sh` / `down.sh` / `smoke.sh` ready to run on the target machine

## Configuration Mapping

One-click does not create an extra global `configs/` layer on the target machine; instead, files are placed directly into each component's native configuration paths:

- `configs/single-node/cubemaster.yaml` → `CubeMaster/conf.yaml`
- `Cubelet/config/` → `Cubelet/config/`
- `Cubelet/dynamicconf/` → `Cubelet/dynamicconf/`
- `configs/single-node/network-agent.yaml` → `network-agent/network-agent.yaml`
- `CubeAPI/bin/cube-api` → `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/CubeAPI/bin/cube-api`
- `support/` → `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/support/`
- `cubeproxy/` → `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/cubeproxy/`

`Cubelet` uses the existing `dynamicconf/conf.yaml` from the repository as-is. At runtime, `network-agent` preferentially reads the network plugin configuration from `Cubelet/config/config.toml` via `--cubelet-config` to stay consistent with `Cubelet`'s network parameters. `cube-api` reads environment variables directly from `.one-click.env` on startup, listening on `0.0.0.0:3000` by default and forwarding to the local `cubemaster`. MySQL/Redis are always deployed to `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/support` and managed by the local `docker compose` on the target machine. `cube proxy` is always deployed to `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/cubeproxy` and built and started locally via `docker compose build && up`.

## Target Machine Installation

After copying `cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>.tar.gz` to the target machine:

```bash
tar -xzf cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>.tar.gz
cd cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>
cp env.example .env
sudo ./install.sh
```

The default installation path is `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox`.

Common commands:

```bash
sudo ./smoke.sh
sudo ./down.sh
```

Before installation, you can explicitly set the current node's internal IP in `.env`. If not set, `install.sh` will attempt to auto-detect the IPv4 address of `eth0`:

```bash
# CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP=10.0.0.10
```

If `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP` is explicitly set, the installation script will use that value directly; otherwise, the auto-detected node IP is written to MySQL's `t_cube_host_info.ip` and `t_cube_sub_host_info.host_ip`, and used to render `cube proxy` / DNS addresses.

### Compute Node Installation

If the first machine has already been deployed as a combined control + compute node, the same release package can be reused on a second machine as a compute-only node:

```bash
tar -xzf cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>.tar.gz
cd cube-sandbox-one-click-<version>
cp env.example .env
```

Set at minimum the following in `.env`:

```bash
ONE_CLICK_DEPLOY_ROLE=compute
ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP=10.0.0.11
```

If you need to explicitly specify the compute node IP, or if the default NIC on the target machine is not `eth0`, also set:

```bash
CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP=10.0.0.12
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo ./install-compute.sh
```

In compute node mode, the installer will:

- Install only `Cubelet`, `network-agent`, `cube-shim`, `cube-image`, `cube-kernel-scf`, and the required scripts.
- Start only `network-agent` and `cubelet`.
- Point `Cubelet`'s `meta_server_endpoint` to `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP:8089`.
- Automatically register the node via the control node's `/internal/meta` API.

Notes:

- All compute nodes must have `Cubelet` listening on the same gRPC port as configured on the control node (default `9999`).
- `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP` is used both as the one-click configuration value and as the `Cubelet` node registration IP.
- The control node must be able to reach port `9999/tcp` on all compute nodes; compute nodes must be able to reach port `8089/tcp` on the control node.

MySQL/Redis dependencies are deployed by default to:

```bash
/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/support
```

During installation, a `docker-compose.yaml` is rendered in this directory to manage:

- `mysql:8.0`
- `redis:7-alpine`

`cube proxy` and its DNS resolution are mandatory capabilities in one-click. The following two values in `.env` must remain `1`:

```bash
CUBE_PROXY_ENABLE=1
CUBE_PROXY_DNS_ENABLE=1
```

Other common parameters:

```bash
CUBE_PROXY_HOST_PORT=443
CUBE_PROXY_CERT_DIR="${ONE_CLICK_INSTALL_PREFIX}/cubeproxy/certs"
CUBE_PROXY_DNS_ANSWER_IP="${CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP}"
CUBE_API_BIND=0.0.0.0:3000
CUBE_API_HEALTH_ADDR=127.0.0.1:3000
CUBE_API_SANDBOX_DOMAIN=cube.app
ALPINE_MIRROR_URL=https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/alpine
PIP_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

During installation, the following steps are performed:

- If `mkcert` is not already installed on the system, it is copied from the bundled `support/bin/mkcert` to `/usr/local/bin/mkcert`. Then `mkcert -install` is run on the host under `CUBE_PROXY_CERT_DIR` (default `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/cubeproxy/certs/`) to generate `cube.app+3.pem` and `cube.app+3-key.pem`.
- A `docker-compose.yaml` is rendered under `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/support/` and MySQL/Redis are started.
- `cubeproxy/global.conf` is rendered using `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP`.
- A `docker-compose.yaml` is generated under `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/cubeproxy/`. The host's `CUBE_PROXY_CERT_DIR` is mounted read-only into the container at `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/certs/`. `ALPINE_MIRROR_URL` / `PIP_INDEX_URL` are passed as build args to `Dockerfile.oneclick` for a local `cube proxy` image build.
- A `CoreDNS` container is started. If `resolvectl` is available, one-click creates a dedicated dummy link (default `cube-dns0`) with a local address, binds CoreDNS to `169.254.254.53` on that link by default, and routes `cube.app` through the link without affecting the host's default public DNS path. If `resolvectl` is unavailable on the target machine, the installer falls back to `NetworkManager + dnsmasq`, continuing to use `127.0.0.54` by default.
- Host processes `network-agent`, `cubemaster`, `cube-api`, and `cubelet` are started, and `cube-api /health` is verified in `quickcheck.sh`.

Stopping one-click will simultaneously stop MySQL/Redis under `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/support`, `cube proxy` / `CoreDNS`, and the host processes `network-agent` / `cubemaster` / `cube-api` / `cubelet`, and will roll back the host DNS routing configuration for `cube.app`.

After deployment, to point the E2B official SDK to the one-click node, set the following on the client side:

```bash
export E2B_API_URL=http://<target-host>:3000
export E2B_API_KEY=dummy
```

## Pre-Installation Preflight Checklist

`install.sh` / `install-compute.sh` performs a one-time preflight check early in the startup process to ensure dependencies fail fast rather than partway through.

### Compute Role (`install-compute.sh`)

Required commands:

- `tar`
- `rg`
- `ss`
- `bash`
- `curl`
- `sed`
- `pgrep`
- `date`

Conditional commands:

- If `ONE_CLICK_ENABLE_TENCENT_DOCKER_MIRROR=1` is enabled and `/etc/docker/daemon.json` already exists, `python3` is required.

### Control Role (`install.sh`, default)

Required commands:

- `docker`
- `tar`
- `rg`
- `ss`
- `bash`
- `curl`
- `sed`
- `pgrep`
- `date`
- `ip`
- `awk`

One-of-two commands:

- Certificate preparation: `mkcert` (bundled in the release package; auto-installed from the package if not present on the system).
- DNS split routing: `resolvectl`, or `systemctl + NetworkManager`.
- If `dnsmasq` is missing and the `NetworkManager` fallback path is taken, one of the following package managers is also required: `dnf` / `yum` / `apt-get`.

Conditional commands:

- If `ONE_CLICK_ENABLE_TENCENT_DOCKER_MIRROR=1` is enabled and `/etc/docker/daemon.json` already exists, `python3` is required.

## Prerequisites

- The target machine requires `root` privileges.
- The target machine preferentially uses `systemd-resolved` / `resolvectl` for split DNS of `cube.app`. The current implementation creates a dedicated dummy link (default `cube-dns0`), assigns it a local `/32` address, binds CoreDNS to `169.254.254.53` on that link by default, and attaches that address plus `~cube.app` to the link. If that capability is unavailable, the installation script will attempt to fall back to `NetworkManager + dnsmasq`, using `127.0.0.54` by default.
- The target machine pulls `mysql:8.0` and `redis:7-alpine` from the internet by default.
- The `mkcert` binary is bundled in the release package (`support/bin/mkcert`). If `mkcert` is not pre-installed on the system, it is automatically copied from the package to `/usr/local/bin/mkcert` — no internet download required.
- TLS certificates and private keys for `cube proxy` are stored on the host under `CUBE_PROXY_CERT_DIR` and mounted read-only into the container via `docker compose`. After updating certificates, simply restart `cube-proxy` or reload nginx inside the container — no image rebuild required.
- The `cube proxy` image build uses Chinese mirrors by default: `ALPINE_MIRROR_URL=https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/alpine` and `PIP_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple`. Override these in `.env` if the target machine uses a different network policy.
- The recommended entry point `build-release-bundle-builder.sh` requires the host machine to have `docker`, `make`, `tar`, `python3`, `truncate`, `ldd`, `mkfs.ext4`, and similar tools.
- The recommended entry point only runs component compilation inside the builder; guest image generation and final packaging are still performed on the host machine.
- If invoking the low-level entry point `build-release-bundle.sh` directly, the build machine must also have local toolchains such as `go`, `cargo`, and `make` installed, depending on the build mode.
- If using the low-level entry point directly or running the recommended entry point for the first time, the build machine must be able to download Go modules from the internet. Configure a usable `GOPROXY` in advance for restricted network environments.
- If the VM path is enabled, the target machine must still satisfy the runtime permission requirements for `network-agent`, tap interfaces, routing, etc.

## Known Limitations

- If `vmlinux` is missing from `assets/kernel-artifacts/`, `build-vm-assets.sh` and `build-release-bundle.sh` will fail immediately. The `cube-kernel-scf.zip` in the release package is generated automatically during the packaging phase.
- If the `deploy/guest-image/Dockerfile` build fails, or the build machine's `mkfs.ext4` does not support the `-d` flag, guest image generation will fail immediately.
- `cube-snapshot/spec.json` is not a mandatory artifact in the current first release of one-click. If absent, the related plugin degrades to a warning rather than blocking the basic startup.
- If the target machine has neither `systemd-resolved` / `resolvectl` nor a restartable `NetworkManager`, one-click will currently report an error, as a third host DNS solution for such environments has not yet been integrated.

## DNS Troubleshooting

- Inspect the current split-DNS state: `resolvectl status`
- Verify the host stub resolver path: `dig +tcp +timeout=3 docker.cnb.cool @127.0.0.53`
- Verify the local CoreDNS path: on the `systemd-resolved` path, run `dig +tcp +timeout=3 foo.cube.app @169.254.254.53`; on the `NetworkManager` fallback path, run `dig +tcp +timeout=3 foo.cube.app @127.0.0.54`
- On the `systemd-resolved` path, the local CoreDNS address should appear only on the dedicated dummy link, not on the default network interface.
